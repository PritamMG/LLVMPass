2. Add the below line to <path-to-llvm-src>/lib/Transforms/CMakeLists.txt

	add_subdirectory(Skeleton)

3. cd <path-to-llvm-build>
4. make

For running the LLVM pass on input program

1. Change the variables path and buildpath in file maybe_can_call as follows:

	path=<path-to-llvm-build>/bin
	buildpath=<path-to-llvm-build>/lib 

2. chmod 755 maybe_can_call (maybe_can_call is a shell script).
